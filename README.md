# Kubernetes Practice Repository
Welcome to my Kubernetes Practice Repository! üëã

This repository is a collection of my experiments, examples, and projects as I deep-dive into the world of Kubernetes. Here, I explore Kubernetes concepts, configurations, and best practices. This repository is a work-in-progress as I continuously learn and practice. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

üõ†Ô∏è Repository Contents
- Basic Kubernetes Objects: Examples of Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
- Networking: Practicing with Services, Ingress resources, and network policies.
- Storage: Configurations for Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims.
- Resource Management: Examples of CPU and memory resource requests and limits.
- Helm Charts: Custom Helm charts for deploying applications in Kubernetes.
- Advanced Topics: Includes configurations for StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, and CronJobs.
- CI/CD Integrations: Kubernetes configurations for automating deployments in CI/CD pipelines.

## Branches Overview
- **master**: This branch contains general Kubernetes practice materials and foundational knowledge.
- **Ingress**: This branch focuses on the deployment of applications using Ingress resources, demonstrating secure and efficient routing for web applications.
- **[Other Branches]**: Additional branches will be created for specific Kubernetes topics, such as networking, storage solutions, resource management, and CI/CD practices.

üöÄ Getting Started
To replicate and run these configurations on your own setup:

1. Install Minikube: A local Kubernetes cluster can be set up with Minikube.
2. Set Up kubectl: Install the Kubernetes CLI tool kubectl for managing the cluster.
