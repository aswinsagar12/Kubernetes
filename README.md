Kubernetes Practice Repository
Welcome to my Kubernetes Practice Repository! 👋

This repository is a collection of my experiments, examples, and projects as I deep-dive into the world of Kubernetes. Here, I explore Kubernetes concepts, configurations, and best practices. This repository is a work-in-progress as I continuously learn and practice. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

🛠️ Repository Contents
Basic Kubernetes Objects: Examples of Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
Networking: Practicing with Services, Ingress resources, and network policies.
Storage: Configurations for Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims.
Resource Management: Examples of CPU and memory resource requests and limits.
Helm Charts: Custom Helm charts for deploying applications in Kubernetes.
Advanced Topics: Includes configurations for StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, and CronJobs.
CI/CD Integrations: Kubernetes configurations for automating deployments in CI/CD pipelines.

🚀 Getting Started
To replicate and run these configurations on your own setup:

Install Minikube: A local Kubernetes cluster can be set up with Minikube.
Set Up kubectl: Install the Kubernetes CLI tool kubectl for managing the cluster.

Clone This Repository:

git clone https://github.com/aswinsagar12/kubernetes.git
cd kubernetes

Apply Kubernetes Files:

kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml

🌱 Current Focus Areas
Understanding core concepts such as Pods, Services, and Ingress.
Working with StatefulSets for stateful applications.
Setting up networking and access controls for secure deployments.
Experimenting with resource management to optimize performance.
